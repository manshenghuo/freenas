
FreeNAS 11 WebUI
================
![CI](https://github.com/freenas/webui/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)


This is the project for the new angular.io WebUI for FreeNAS 11. It is meant to coexist with current FreeNAS 11 Django/Dojo WebUI.

# Development requirements

  - yarn >= 1.12
  - Node.js >= 8.9
  - Running FreeNAS 11 Nightly Machine (VM is fine)


# Getting started

Install the development requirements (FreeBSD 11 or later):

```sh
# pkg install yarn
```

Checkout FreeNAS git repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/freenas/webui.git
$ cd webui
```

Install yarn packages:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

Run the environment configuration script
(if your ip address changes later you may repeat this step)

```sh
$ ./setup_env.js -i <ip address or FQDN of the server where FreeNAS is running>
```

To start run
```yarn start```

This runs a local webserver with the new WebUI, by default at http://localhost:4200.
If this webserver is kept running, changes to the project will be rebuilt incrementally.

To test AOT in dev mode run

```yarn run start:dev:aot```

To run the production build, run

```yarn run build:prod:aot```

Getting errors about missing packages?

```yarn install```

Getting permission errors or Failed messages when trying to run `yarn start`?

From the webui repo
```
rm -rf node_modules (may need root)
rm yarn.lock 
yarn cache clean --force
yarn install
```
This should bring the yarn environment back to a useable state.

# Translating Text to Other Languages

To extract all of the strings from the project to be translated run:
```yarn run extract```

This will update all of the PO files located in the directory src/assets/i18n.
These can be edited with any PO editor.
