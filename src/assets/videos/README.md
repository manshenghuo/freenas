### Video Files

Use this directory to add video files that can be embedded into helptext.
A video can be embedded with the use of the "video" tag like such:

```
<video src="assets/videos/1280.mp4" width="128" height="96" controls></video>
```

This will add a video with controls that let the user start/stop the video into a tooltip.
